# Data Description
The dataset pertains to a car price dataset that includes information about various car models, their specifications, and the price. The dataset consists of multiple records and columns, which include:

- *Brand*: Name of the car manufacturer.
- *Model*: Name of the car model.
- *Year*: Year of manufacturing.
- *Engine_Size*: Engine size in liters.
- *Fuel_Type*: Type of fuel used by the car (Petrol, Diesel, etc.).
- *Mileage*: Distance the car has traveled (in kilometers).
- *Doors*: Number of doors in the vehicle.
- *Owner_Count*: Number of previous owners.
- *Price*: Price of the car.

# Overview of the Jupyter Notebook
The notebook includes various analyses and visualizations of the car price dataset, including:

## Data Preprocessing
- *Load Dataset*: Loaded car_price_dataset.csv into a DataFrame.
- *Display Data*: Displayed the first few rows of the dataset.
- *Check Missing Values*: Checked for any missing values.
- *Handle Missing Values*: Filled missing values with Unknown or an appropriate value.
- *Check Data Types*: Validated column data types.
- *Convert Data Types*: Converted data to appropriate formats:
  - Year, Mileage, Doors, Owner_Count, Price → int
  - Engine_Size → float

## Data Cleaning & Summary Statistics
- *Drop Unnecessary Columns*: Removed missing or unnecessary columns.
- *Check for Duplicates*: Identified duplicate rows.
- *Remove Duplicates*: Dropped duplicate rows using drop_duplicates().
- *Summary Statistics*: Generated descriptive statistics for numerical columns.

# Data Analysis & Visualizations
The notebook includes various visualizations to understand the dataset better:
- *Average Price by Brand*: Bar plot showing average price for each car brand.
- *Distribution of Car Prices*: Histogram to display the distribution of car prices.
- *Correlation Matrix*: Heatmap to identify relationships between numerical columns.
- *Mileage vs. Price Scatter Plot*: Scatter plot to visualize the relationship between mileage and price.
- *Price by Fuel Type*: Box plot highlighting price differences by fuel type.
- *Top 10 Popular Car Models*: Bar chart of the most popular car models.

# Data Insights
Key insights derived from the analysis include:

- *Brand Influence on Price*: Significant variation in average car prices across brands.
- *Mileage Impact on Price*: Higher mileage often results in lower prices.
- *Fuel Type and Price*: Fuel type impacts car prices, with Petrol cars generally priced lower than Diesel models.
- *Duplicate Records*: Duplicates were found and removed, ensuring data consistency.
- *Price Variability by Model*: Popular models show price fluctuations based on demand.

# Conclusion
The analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing car prices, which can help potential buyers and sellers make informed decisions. The data preprocessing and visualization steps highlight essential trends and correlations within the dataset.
